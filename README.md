# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

 List five significant features of React

 Speed
 React basically allows developers to utilize individual parts of their application on both the client-side and the server-side, which ultimately boosts the speed of the development process.

 Flexibility
 Compared to other frontend frameworks, the React code is easier to maintain and is flexible due to its modular structure. This flexibility, in turn, saves a huge amount of time and cost to businesses.

 Usability
 Deploying React is fairly easy to accomplish if you have some basic knowledge of JavaScript.
 
In fact, an expert JavaScript developer can easily learn all ins and outs of the React framework in a matter of a day or two.

 It helps to build rich user interfaces
 The quality of the user interface in an application plays an important role. If the user interface is poorly designed, then it lowers the chances of an application to succeed.

 But, if an application has a high-quality UI, then there are better chances that your users will love to use the app.

 It uplifts developers’ productivity
 Frequent updates often turn into headaches when an app has a complex logic and when a single modification in one component can dramatically affect other components.
 But, to combat this problem, Facebook has amplified React with the component reusability feature.



 List five major advantages of React

 Faster rendering.
 Stable Code Structure.
 Handy developer tools.
 Mobile app development.
 Easy to Learn, Easy to Use.

 4. What is the name of the Software Engineer that created React? Also, which company owns React?

 React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook.

 5.
 One of the major differences between HTML and JSX is that in JSX, you must return a single parent element, or it won't compile.

Many devs use <div>...</div>, but a better one that many people use is “fragment”, <>...</> which makes the code more readable.

In HTML, you are free to do whatever you want as you don’t have to return a single parent element.

b. In JSX, it is possible to write JavaScript directly. You can do this by putting the JavaScript in curly braces {...}. Whereas in HTML, you need a script tag or an external JavaScript file to implement JavaScript

c. Self-closing tags in JSX must have the forward slash whereas the forward slash is optional in the HTML self-closing tags.

6. Browsers can't read JSX becuse it is not a JavaScript
