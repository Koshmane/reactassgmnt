// List five significant features of React

// Speed
// React basically allows developers to utilize individual parts of their application on both the client-side and the server-side, which ultimately boosts the speed of the development process.

// Flexibility
// Compared to other frontend frameworks, the React code is easier to maintain and is flexible due to its modular structure. This flexibility, in turn, saves a huge amount of time and cost to businesses.

// Usability
// Deploying React is fairly easy to accomplish if you have some basic knowledge of JavaScript.

// In fact, an expert JavaScript developer can easily learn all ins and outs of the React framework in a matter of a day or two.

// It helps to build rich user interfaces
// The quality of the user interface in an application plays an important role. If the user interface is poorly designed, then it lowers the chances of an application to succeed.

// But, if an application has a high-quality UI, then there are better chances that your users will love to use the app.

// It uplifts developersâ€™ productivity
// Frequent updates often turn into headaches when an app has a complex logic and when a single modification in one component can dramatically affect other components.
// But, to combat this problem, Facebook has amplified React with the component reusability feature.



// what are the major advantages of React

// Faster rendering.
// Stable Code Structure.
// Handy developer tools.
// Mobile app development.
// Easy to Learn, Easy to Use.

// 4. What is the name of the Software Engineer that created React? Also, which company owns React?
